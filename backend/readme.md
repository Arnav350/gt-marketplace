### To Do List Django 

To Do list is a project created using Django and html. 

I defined models for id, title, completed, and created_at. If id and title are empty, then the user receives a 404 error message through the error handling code that I implemented. 

Within the whole project, the user has the ability to navigate between tasks and also has a back button once they add or update a task. The user is also asked whether they want to delete a task before it is deleted.
